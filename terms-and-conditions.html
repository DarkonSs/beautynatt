                    mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively,
                    the “Site”). You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agreed
                    to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN
                    YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SITE AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>

                <p>Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are
                    hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to
                    make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use at any time and for any reason. We will alert
                    you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use, and you
                    waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to
                    periodically review these Terms of Use to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to and will
                    be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use
                    by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Terms of Use are posted.</p>

                <p>The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or
                    entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
                    regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or
                    country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on
                    their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent

                    and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if
                    your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use the
                    Site in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

                <p>The Site is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the

                    the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
                    exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of
                    such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
                    assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                    or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
                    control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful,
                    void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms
                    of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no
